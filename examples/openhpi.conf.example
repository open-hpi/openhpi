## File format is outlined here and examples are given

## First section, declare global parameters like the following.

#OPENHPI_LOG_ON_SEV = "MINOR"
#OPENHPI_ON_EP = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,1}"
#OPENHPI_DEL_MAX_SIZE = "0"
#OPENHPI_DAT_MAX_SIZE = "0"
#OPENHPI_DAT_USER_LIMIT = "0"
#OPENHPI_THREADED = "NO"
#OPENHPI_PATH = "/usr/local/lib/openhpi:/usr/lib/openhpi"

## The default values for each have been selected in the example above (except
## for OPENHPI_PATH and OPENHPI_CONF. See below).
## No need to specify any one of them because the default will be used
## automatically. The library will also look for these as environment variables.
## Environment variables found that match a global parameter will override the
## corresponding parameter set in this configuration file.
##
## OPENHPI_LOG_SEV sets the lowest severity level an event must meet to be
## logged in the domain event log. Possible values are (highest to lowest):
## "CRITICAL", "MAJOR", "MINOR", "INFORMATIONAL", "OK", and "DEBUG".
## OPENHPI_ON_EP sets the entity path on wich the application is running. This
## entity path will be returned when SaHpiResourceIdGet() is called.
## OPENHPI_DEL_MAX_SIZE sets the maximum size (in number of event log entries)
## for the domain event log. "0" means unlimited.
## OPENHPI_DAT_MAX_SIZE sets the maximum size (in number of alarm entries) for
## the alarm table. "0" means unlimited.
## OPENHPI_DAT_USER_LIMIT sets the maximum number of user type alarm entries
## allowed in the alarm table.
## OPENHPI_PATH is a colon (:) delimited list of directories specifying
## the location of openhpi plugin libraries. The default is defined when the
## library is configured.
## OPENHPI_THREADED sets whether a thread is used for handling the event loop.
## This thread will be looping around the plugin instances and fetching events.

## Second section, declare plugin to use. For example:
## plugin plugin-name

plugin libdummy

## Depends on openipmi to be installed on this system:
#plugin libipmi

## Depends on net-snmp being installed on the system:
#plugin libsnmp_bc

## Depends openhpi being configured 
## (e.g "configure --enable-dummy=static")
#plugin dummy

#plugin libipmidirect

#############################################################################
##**WARNING** System administrators have to make sure that entity paths are
## unique in a domain. To avoid entity paths conflicting among handlers, make
## sure the "entity_root" is unique for each handler definition.
#############################################################################
## Third section is a handler (instance) declaration with arguments understood by plugin
## Strings are enclosed by "", numbers are not.

handler	libdummy {
        entity_root = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,1}"
        name = "test"
	addr =	0
}

## Dummy allows you open second virtual by addr 1
#handler libdummy {
#	addr =	1
#}

## Section for ipmi plugin using SMI -- local interface

#handler libipmi	{
#       entity_root = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,2}"
#	name = "smi"
#	addr = 0
#}

## Section for ipmi plugin based on OpenIPMI:

#handler libipmi {
#       entity_root = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,3}"
#	name = "lan"
#	addr = "x.x.x.x" 	#ipaddress
#	port = 999
#	auth_type = "straight"
#	auth_level= "user"
#	username = "joe"
#	password = "blow"
#}

## Section for snmp_bc plugin:
## The root entry can be omitted in 'entity_root',
## but *not* the chassis entry.
#handler libsnmp_bc {
#        entity_root = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,4}" # Required
#        host = "bc.ibm.com" # Required
#        community = "community" # Version 1 Required.
#        version = "1" # Required. SNMP protocol version (1|3)
#        security_name = "snmpv3_user" # Version 3 Required.
#        passphrase = "opensesame" # Version 3. Required if security_level is authNoPriv or authPriv.
#        auth_type = "MD5" # Version 3. Passphrase encoding (MD5|SHA)
#        security_level = "noAuthNoPriv" # Version 3. (noAuthNoPriv|authNoPriv|authPriv)
#}

## Section for static dummy plugin:
## If openhpi configured with
## configure --enable-dummy=static
## the dummy plugin is compiled in.
## It is possible to use dummy and libdummy
## at the same time.
#handler dummy {
#        entity_root = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,5}"
#        name = "test"
#        addr = 2
#}

## Section for ipmidirect plugin using SMI -- local interface
#handler libipmidirect {
#       entity_root = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,6}"
#	name = "smi"
#	addr = 0
#}

## Section for ipmidirect plugin using RMCP:
#handler libipmidirect {
#        entity_root = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,7}"
#        name = "lan"       # RMCP
#        addr = "localhost" # ipaddress
#        port = "623"      # RMCP port
#        auth_type = "none" # none, md2, md5 or straight
#	 auth_level = "admin" # none, callback, user, operator or admin
#	 username = "arthur"
#        password = "pieman"
#        logflags = ""      # logging off
#        # logflags = "file stdout"
#        # infos goes to logfile and stdout
#        # the logfile are log00.log, log01.log ...
#        # if #logfile_max reached replace the oldest one
#        logfile = "log"
#        logfile_max = 10
#}
