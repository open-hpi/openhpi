    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>OpenHPI is an open source project created with the intent of providing
an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's Hardware Platform Interface (HPI).
HPI provides a universal interface for creating resource system models, typically for chassis
and rack based servers, but extendable for other problem domains such as clustering,
virtualization and simulation.

      <title>Purpose of this Document</title>
      <para>This document is intended to combine collaborated design effort into a single
location.  This HLD should specify the implementation, including inter-component
dependencies, providing sufficient design detail to correctly implement the SA Forum's HPI 
for multiple platforms.</para>

      <title>Document Scope</title>
      <para>This high-level design covers all levels of design and may evolve into a low-level design
as the document matures. Anyone interested in understanding the OpenHPI internal design should read this
document.</para>

      <title>Plugin Mechanism</title>
      <para>An OpenHPI plugin shall implement HAI. A plugin shall 
export <emphasis>get_interface</emphasis>, symbols by a dynamic linking mechanism which the infrastructure supports. 
The symbol should refer to a function, which shall return a proper pointer to an interface by
a unique interface ID (UUID). The interface is a structure containing a bundle of function 
pointers. The plugin may implement one or more versions of interface according to different UUIDs. 
Each UUID identifies a specific version the HAI. A newer OpenHPI implementation shall recognize 
older plugins and provide backwards compatibility.

      <title>Usage Scenarios</title>
      <para>
The scope of the SA-Forum's HPI Specification could be interpreted as 
dealing with only local resources to a platform (where platforms are traditional 
rack mounted servers or chassis containing many bladed computer systems on a 
common management bus), or as a network of computer systems. The following usage 
scenario represents the view of a an OpenHPI implementation that spans across 
multiple computer systems. 
      </para>
      <para>
The following scenario is presented to spawn design discussions for OpenHPI 
and help flush out some of the more vague portions of the HPI specification 
(like remoting capabilities.) 
      </para>
      <para>
For this scenario, a rack of computers is closely coupled together to provide a 
single service in the same way that a single telecommunication application would 
span across multiple platforms all configured for that one application. 
      </para>
      <para>
The rack consists of:  
       </para>
      <itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>
      <listitem>
      <para>shelf manager: platform hosting middle-ware that uses OpenHPI to 
get a platform view of the entire rack of computers 
      </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
      <para>terminal server: common terminal server to aid advanced trouble shooting 
of a given node 
      </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
      <para>ATCA Chassis: Bladed server chassis full of single board computers 
and other FRU's all connected together via a common IPMI management bus 
      </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
      <para>DB Server: Traditional database server as is seen in data centers 
      </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
      <para>UPS: A couple of UPS units providing redundant power
      </para>
      </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
      <imagedata fileref="physical_view.png" />
      </para>
      <para>
As mentioned before, the full rack of computers is tightly coupled together 
to perform a single service, so from the services view this entire setup is a 
single platform. Assuming OpenHPI contains the ability to remotely plug physically 
separate computer systems into a single tree as described in the HPI specification, 
our scenario is configured to see the following HPI view: 
      </para>
      <para>
      <imagedata fileref="domain_view.png" />
      </para>
      <para>
One possible high level design for enabling such a remotely pluggable capabilities could be done like: 
      </para>
      <para>
      <imagedata fileref="implementation_view.png" />
      </para>
      <para>
In the above diagram, the software components that understands specific hardware 
management components (like IPMI) would be isolated into "domain servers". In 
addition to this a remote and local mechanism would be provided for domain servers 
to be plugged into each other, resulting in the HPI tree needed for the specific solution.
