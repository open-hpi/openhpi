  <title>OpenHPI Plugin Usage</title>
  <para>
    This chapter is an overview of the existing plugins for OpenHPI,
    and how one needs to configured them for usage.  It is expected
    that this will grow over time as new plugins are added.
  </para>
  <sect1>
    <title>General Configuration</title>
    <para>
      To add a plugin for usage by OpenHPI one has to add at least 2
      stanzas to the <literal>/etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf</literal>
      file.  These are a <literal>plugin</literal> and
      <literal>handler</literal> stanza.  An example configuration
      file is shown below.

plugin libdummy

handler libdummy {
          entity_root = "{ROOT,0}{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,2}"
}          

plugin libsnmp_bc

handler libsnmp_bc {
          community = "mypass"
          host = "10.0.0.1"
          entity_root = "{ROOT,0}{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,0}"

          community = "mypass"

    <title>Dummy Plugin</title>
    <para>
      The Dummy Plugin is a test plugin that was first used to test
      the infrastructure.  It is still useful for testing a new
      feature in the infrastructure without having hardware supported
      by OpenHPI.
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      <para>
        None.  The dummy plugin consists of static data specified
        within the plugin.  It requires no special hardware or
        software to run.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <para>
        There is no required configuration for the dummy plugin (I
        know this isn't true, but I'll leave this for someone else to write).
      </para>

    <title>SNMP Blade Center Plugin</title>
    <para>
      The SNMP Blade Center plugin is an SNMP based interface to IBM's
      Blade Center hardware.  Technical information about Blade Center
      is best found at <ulink
        url="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/bladecenter/"
        >the Blade Center Home 
        Page</ulink>.
      
    </para>
    <para>
      This plugin is called <literal>snmp_bc</literal> in the OpenHPI tree, and will be
      referenced by the name <literal>libsnmp_bc</literal> in all
      OpenHPI configuration files.
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      <para>
        The snmp_bc plugin is not currently built by default in the
        OpenHPI build process.  In order to enable the building of the
        snmp_bc module one must add the configure flag
        <literal>--enable-snmp_bc</literal> during the configure
        process.
      </para>
      <para>
        snmp_bc relies on Net-SNMP >= 5.0.  most testing has
        been done with >= 5.0.7 so the latest version available for
        your distribution is recommended.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Blade Center hardware must also be SNMP enabled to
        interface with this plugin properly.  This requires that the
        Management Module firmware be >= 1.0.4.  As of the time of
        this writing 1.0.6 is available and can be found at
        <ulink
          url="http://www-3.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-45487"
          >the IBM Support Site</ulink>.
        Instructions are included there for upgrading the firmware.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once the firmware is updated, one must use the Management
        Module web interface to enable SNMP access.  This is found
        under the Networking options in the web interface.  There is a
        field to both set the community string (i.e. password) and up
        to 3 allowed hosts to connect to the Management Module.
        Ensure that what host will be running OpenHPI is in that list
        of allowed hosts.
