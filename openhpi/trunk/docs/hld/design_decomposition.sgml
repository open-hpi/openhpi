  <title>Current Design</title>
  <sect1>
    <title>Guiding Principles</title>
    <para>
      There are a few guiding principals behind 
      the design and implementation of the OpenHPI project. To succeed, 
      the project must be: 
    </para>
    <itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>Simple</emphasis> - the easier the code is to
          follow, the easier it is to find and fix bugs.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>Reliable</emphasis> - OpenHPI will be used in very
          dynamic environments, and will need to be as robust as
          possible.  To this end, the reliance on well known, well
          debugged external libraries is perfered to writing our own
          implementations of the same functions.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>Efficient</emphasis> - this is both in terms of
          performance as well as code re-use.         
          For performance, the reasons are obvious; you don't want your management layers 
          to bring down the performance of your system. In regard to code re-use--the more 
          that pieces of code can be re-used the faster that others can develop hardware 
          specific components to sit within the OpenHPI domain. 
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Implementation</title>
    <para>
      To meet the above requirements the design is broken down into four major areas. 
      Each of these areas will eventually be defined in detail on subsequent pages. Brief 
      descriptions are provided below.
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Application Interface Stubs</title>
      <para>This portion deals with the code that provides the entry points into 
        the libhpi.so. Initially this will literally just contain stubs that provide 
        API compliance without any features. Stub APIs will output to the stderr a 
        TODO: Implement _api_ message. As the api is implemented, these output messages 
        will be removed.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Infrastructure</title>
      <para>The core library is considered infrastructure.  This is the
        section of code which provides and internal representation of
        resources and events, and exposes them as HPI data structures.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Utility Functions</title>
      <para>
        The utility functions need by OpenHPI are provided by the
        glib utility library, this includes linked list and hash
        implementations.  This is a well tested library used by
        many open source projects (including gtk, gnome, and linux-ha).
        It is thread safe, so proper utilization of the library for
        OpenHPI data structures will ensure that OpenHPI is thread safe
        as well.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>OpenHPI Plugin Interface</title>
      <para>The OpenHPI plugin interface is the method of communication
        between the OpenHPI infrastructure and real hardware.  It is
        designed to be abstract enough to allow communication to any
        type of hardware over any sane interface (be that a device
        driver or network protocol).
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>OpenHPI Plugins</title>
      <para>There exist a number of plugins in the OpenHPI source tree
        to enable different types of hardware and other interfaces.  The
        current ones are listed below:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>
        <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>Dummy</emphasis> - a static plugin which provides
            a number or resources statically to test the infrastructure.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis>IPMI</emphasis> - an IPMI interface module based
            on the libOpenIPMI library developed by Correy Minyard.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis>Watchdog</emphasis> - an interface to the Linux
            watchdog device.  Softdog can be used in place of a real
            hardware watchdog.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis>Text_remote</emphasis> - a remoting plugin which
            talks to the openhpi daemon on a remote machine.  This
            allows multiple instances of hpi to be seen together in a
            single domain.
          </para>
        </listitem>
