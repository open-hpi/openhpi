Unit tests we should have for rpt_utils.
_____________________________________________________
Note:
To find the file where the test is implemented,
find its number and prepend it with "rpt_utils_"
and append it with ".c" so that it looks somthing
like "rpt_utils_024.c".
_____________________________________________________

The possitive tests:
Start with empty RPTable
    - add 1 resource
          - fetch by id, compare (000)
          - fetch by ep, compare (001)
    - add 1 resource w/data, fetch data, compare (002)
    - add 10 resources, in random order
          - fetch by id, compare (003)
          - fetch by ep, compare (004)
    - add 10 resources w/data, fetch data in random order, compare (005)
    - add 10 resources, start at beginning, call next on each one, compare ResourceId (006)
    - add 10 resources, start at beginning, call next on each one, compare RPTentry (007)
    - add 10 resources, start at random resource, call next to get to the end,
      compare rid (008)
    
Start with 10 resources
    - add 1 rdr to first resource
          - fetch by id, compare (009)
          - fetch by type, compare (010)
    - add 1 rdr
    	- resource must have SAHPI_CAPABILITY_AGGREGATE_STATUS capability,
	  sensor num should be between SAHPI_STANDARD_SENSOR_MIN and
	  SAHPI_STANDARD_SENSOR_MAX and less than SENSOR_AGGREGATE_MAX.
    - add 5 rdrs to first resource, in random order
          - fetch by id, compare (011)
          - fetch by type, compare (012)
          - fetch by next, compare (013)
    - add 5 rdrs of for each of these types:
    	- Control
	- Inventory
	- Watchdog
      	- Annunciator

Start with 10 resources, multiple rdrs on some resources
    - remove resource
             - search for resource by id (014)
             - search for resource by ep (015)
             - call next through chain, make sure things are right (016)
    - remove rdr
             - search for rdr by id (017)
             - search for rdr by type (018)
             - call next through chain, make sure things are right (019)
    - flush rpt - check to see if there are no resources left in the table (062)
    
Check rpt info
    - add a resource, and check that rpt info has been modified. (068)

Start with two tables using rpt_diff
    - One empty (current table) and one with 10 resources with an rdr each
      (new table). Get the difference. Expect 10 new resources and 10 rdrs.
    - Same as above, but the current table will have the resources. The new
      table will be empty. Expect 10 gone resources and rdrs.
    - Current table and new table with 10 resources in each. 5 resources in
      the new table should be new and the other 5 should be updates from the
      current table. Expect 10 new resources and rdrs in total and 5
      resources/rdrs in the gone lists.

Speed Tests:
    - Add 10,000 resources. Time how long it takes to fetch last one. (1000)
