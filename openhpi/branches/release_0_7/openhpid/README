This directory contains the openhpi daemon and client library.

openhpiclient.c     - open HPI client code
openhpiclient.conf  - sample configuration for the client library
openhpid.cpp        - the daemon
simple_config.c     - general config file reading code

To run type:
openhpid -d 31
This enables debug messages of the daemon.
To run more than one daemon on the same machine, use
the option -c config_file for different configurations.

To use the daemon, link you HPI application to -lopenhpiclient -lpthread
not -lopenhpi. To run hpitest with the daemon/client library just
change hpitest/v1/1.0/LDFLAGS.
Be aware, hpitest will run in unexpected high speed.
